Eight AMS 14C dates were obtained on monospecific foraminifers’ samples (Globigerina inflata) and one on a multiespecies foraminifer sample ( Table 2). However, only four dates were included in the age model since the other four seem contaminated with old material (Fig. 2B). A contamination that can be the consequence of increasing the slope instability derived from changes in the sea level during the last deglaciation, as proposed by Lebreiro et al. (2009)."
