The midpoint of the top dated sample is 14 density band couplets above the profile for geochemical measurements, and the midpoint of the bottom dated sample is seven band couplets below the profile (Fig. 2). In other words, the age model within the chronology is based on the annual banding. According to band couplet counts and the number of annual cycles in the d18O, the U/Th-dated sections differ in age by 104 yr, while the difference is 130 yr according to their radiometric dates (base: 1499, top: 1629 AD). To remove the surplus of 26 yr we adjusted the radiometric ages by adding 13 yr to the bottom and subtracting 13 yr from the top sample age. Therefore, individual years in our record are correct with respect to their positions within the time series, but they do not necessarily match calendar years. Years in the isotopic record are defined by cyclic variations in d18O, which are assumed to be annual, with each cycle spanning ca. 2.5-4 mm core length. Subannual dating is based on the annual d18O cycles, where the most positive d18O value in each cycle is assigned to the coldest average month, which, for Bermuda, is March.

Over the course of the 200-year record, long-term trends in mean annual and wintertime dOc (0.0003%/a and < 0.0001%/a, respectively) are effectively flat (Figures 4a and 4b).

X radiographs for these corals have been previously published [Goodkin, 2007; Goodkin et al., 2007, 2005]. Some error is expected within this age model because of years of very little or no growth, not visible on the X ray and also not clearly discernible in the seasonal cycles of Sr/Ca. While there is the potential for error generated by noise in the Sr/Ca or the annual band counting to result in the inappropriate addition of a year, the majority of age model error will arise because of missing years, generating a bias in which coral bands are assigned to artificially recent (younger) dates. For example, if the coral did not grow in 1950, 1949 would be inappropriately assigned the date 1950, and similarly for all coral years prior to 1950 (1781?1949). Such age model bias is suspected during the early to mid-1800s when growth rates were extremely slow for an extended period of time and hiatuses in growth may have occurred [Goodkin et al., 2005].",,counting,year,"we show that with the present coral record and relatively short calibration data set, we are unable to derive a robust, statistically significant separation of the salinity and temperature signals within the coral d18O.",,negative,,linear,T_water,1,,"There are several factors that may prevent the quantification of these relationships, the most likely being the lack of large changes in SSS documented in the instrumental data.

Figure 1C compares the d18Oresidual with a regional precipitation index computed from weather stations in the southeastern Caribbean, which includes the study site.

Geochemical variations in d18O were used to determine a first-order age model, with the maximum intra-annual peaks in d18O being assigned as the coldest month of the year (August), beginning with the year 2007, when the living coral was cored. This first-order age model places d18O variations in the time domain, with uneven time increments (Dt). A second-order age model, with a monthly Dt, was created using the AnalySeries software program, which was verified by comparing years with anomalous d18O values to known ENSO events where possible. This second-order age model is the final age model used in all plots and data analysis.","~1?2 months in any given year, no errors given for annual chronology",chronological,month,"We develop and test a transfer function constructed using linear regression analysis of SBV coral d18Oanomaly variations and instrumental SSS over the period 1970?2007 CE [Thirumalai et al., 2011]. We performed a calibration-verification exercise (Figure 6) between d18Oanomaly and SSS at SBV to assess the robustness of the transfer function [Quinn and Sampson, 2002]. The slopes in equations (1)?(3) are within error of each other; however, the intercepts are slightly different. Despite this small difference, the similarity of the lines (Figure S2) provides confidence that the transfer function developed in this study can be used to reconstruct past changes in salinity at this locality based on coral d18O variations. We also note that there is a signal in the residuals, which likely reflects a small temperature component in the coral d18O anomaly signal (Figure 6, bottom), most likely due to the small changes in seasonality over this time period (Figure 4c).",1.973,positive,44%,linear,Salinity_water,1,,"We found that the correlations with d18O are 0.72 (with total pseudocoral), 0.47 (with SST component), and 0.68 (with SSS component), p < 0.01 for all three (Figure S1), indicating that SSS changes represent a larger fraction of the variance in the coral d18Oanomaly signal than SST changes, as expected from the larger magnitude of interannual SSS variations at this site. Testing several different percent contributions of SSS and SST to create the pseudocoral, we determined that a combination of 35% SST and 65% SSS results in the closest representation to the observed coral d18Oanomaly values. This was calculated by creating a pseudocoral that consisted of percent SST/SSS contributions that ranged from 100/0% to 0/100%, in increments of 5% (i.e., 100/0, 95/5, 90/10… 5/95, 0/100). The pseudocoral consisting of 35/65% gave the highest correlation with the measured d18O time series, which provides the percent contributions of SST and SSS to the time series. This relationship was determined over the period 1970–2007, and is limited by the length of the instrumental SSS data set. We assume stationarity in the proportional contributions of SST and SSS to the coral d18O signal because SSS data needed to evaluate this assumption are lacking in the pre- 1970 period. However, the assumption of stationarity of a proxy-instrumental relationship developed over the instrumental time period affects all proxy-based climate reconstructions that extend beyond the instrumental period. Thus, lacking additional instrument data and/or another independent SST- or SSS-only proxy there is no easy way to reduce the uncertainty of the empirically derived proxy relationship over the calibration-verification interval.",-0.21‰ per degrees C,negative,0.22,linear,T_water,2,,,,,,,,,,,"DMT (1/14/19) MNE, NJA",TRUE,http://lipdverse.org/iso2kv0_8_4/CO12GOVA.html,,DMT (1/14/19)

Comparison of the d180 with SST and rainfall records indicates a correlation of 0.71 and 0.54, respectively, over the 13-year interval where data overlaps (Fig. 2). Just as in the precipitation and SST comparison, the correlation is much higher at the annual cycle (coherence of 0.95). There is also a slight suggestion of coherence at the El Nino time scale, but the calibration time series is too short to draw any definitive conclusions. Since the 0.71 correlation between SST and d180 explains only half the variance in the SST record, other factors are obviously responsible for the d180 variations.

Each couplet of one low- and one high-density band represents the growth of one year. The higher-resolving age model is based on the assumption, that coral d18O primarily depends on temperature. In the d18O data deriving from an annual banding couplet the highest value was assigned to the mid of September, the coldest month on average. The chronology is thus tied to one point within each year; the ages of the other sampling points were linearly interpolated according to their spatial distances along the sampling profile. In skeletal portions with unclear density banding pattern the stratigraphy is solely based on cyclic variations in coral d18O.

Furthermore, time series of d18O and atmospheric D14C are generally coherent after 700 AD. Both the Pacific climate and solar irradiance probably played a role in drought occurrence, but their effects were non-stationary through the late Holocene.;a highly significant, positive correlation (r = 0.63, n = 32, p < 0.0001) exists between d18O and the PDO.

Firstly, the heavy rains associated with moderate-to-strong El Nin?o events are thought to dilute the nutrient pool and cause oligotrophic conditions. El Junco Lake is an endorheic lake (with the exception of occasional overflow conditions and possibly seepage) located within a caldera with a small catchment area consisting only of the narrow crater rim (Conroy et al., 2008). In such lakes the con- centration of nutrients tend to decrease as lake levels increase through dilution of the incoming nutrients (Smol et al., 2001; Magyari et al., 2009). Because monthly rainfall in this area can be an order of magnitude higher during strong El Nin?o events as com- pared to non-El Nin?o periods (cf., Fig. 4) and the lake has been re- ported to overflow during strong El Nin?o events, considerable dilu- tion and flushing of nutrients likely occur during these times. Sec- ondly, reduced nutrient input to the lake exacerbates oligotrophic conditions during strong El Nin?o events. A major source of nutri- ents to the lake is thought to be guano deposited directly into the lake by the large number of seabirds that frequent it (Colinvaux, 1968). Such a predominance of avian-derived nutrients has been documented in a number of lake systems (Manny et al., 1994; Marion et al., 1994). However, during strong El Nin?o events, this nutrient source is diminished as the Gala?pagos seabird population plummets in response to the massive fish die-offs associated with a deep thermocline and low ocean productivity in the EEP (Gibbs, 1987). Finally, El Nin?o events in the EEP are associated with con- ditions that increase water column stability and lake stratification, including warmer air temperatures, reduced cloud cover, and re- duced trade wind strength (Lewis Jr., 1983; O?Reilly et al., 2003; Ndebele-Murisa et al., 2010; Co?zar et al., 2012), conditions which have been shown to exacerbate nutrient depletion in the surface of oligotrophic lakes (O?Reilly et al., 2003). Increases in water column stability during El Nin?o events should further promote favorable conditions for the oil-rich, colony-forming B. braunii due to their buoyancy. In various lo- cations across the globe, B. braunii blooms have been strongly linked to increases in water column stability due to both their tolerance of oligotrophic conditions and their anti-sinking strategy (Kebede and Belay, 1994; Souza et al., 2008; Winder and Hunter, 2008). In particular, in a Columbian lake with conditions (including depth, pH, conductivity, and nutrient concentration) comparable to El Junco Lake, B. braunii blooms have been found to occur dur- ing the annual flood stage in association with nutrient flushing, oligotrophic conditions, and lake stratification (Pinilla, 2006), con- ditions that closely mimic moderate to strong El Nin?o events in El Junco Lake.

We interpret these large changes in δ2Haq to indicate changes in precipitation sea- sonality, with Arctic moisture sources contributing to the exceptionally low δ2H values. The magnitude and direc- tion of δ2Haq changes cannot be explained by changes in terrestrial plant contributions of C24 n-alkanoic acids, by Holocene temperature change, or by lake water residence time (Figures S6 and S7 in the supporting information).Lake N3 δ2Haq decreased steadily from !190 to !300‰ from 7.5 to 6 ka, in step with declining sea ice in Disko Bugt (Figures 2a and 2b) [Ouellet-Bernier et al., 2014]. Lake N3 δ2Haq remained low during the middle Holocene, synchronous with minimum regional sea ice. The Labrador Sea, an important moisture source region for wes- tern Greenland [Sodemann et al., 2008], had minimum sea ice cover from 6.5 to 3.5 ka (Figure 2b) [de Vernal et al., 2013]. Furthermore, sea ice reached a minimum in northern Baffin Bay and the Canadian Arctic from 6 to 3 ka [Ledu et al., 2010; de Vernal et al., 2013], creating a source for moisture that was 2H-depleted compared to mod- ern winter precipitation around Lake N3. Although Baffin Bay still had seasonal sea ice during the middle Holocene, sea ice would have formed later in the year [Markus et al., 2009]. A loss of sea ice during early winter, when evaporation is greatest, can cause large increases in early winter snowfall [Bintanja and Selten, 2014]. Finally, the West Greenland Current was both strong and warm 6 to 4 ka, likely due to an increased contribution of the warm Irminger Current to the West Greenland Current, resulting in regional warmth and providing energy to evaporate more moisture (Figures 2c and 2d) [Perner et al., 2013]. Winter insolation was low during the middle Holocene [Laskar et al., 2004], so there was likely a large contrast between winter air temperature and winter ocean surface temperature. This temperature contrast would cause high evaporation. Thus, we inter- pret the significant middle Holocene depletion of Lake N3 δ2Haq as an increase in winter precipitation, caused by the near total loss of sea ice cover in the Labrador Sea, and the loss of early winter sea ice and increased ocea- nic heat advection in Baffin Bay.

It is not surprising that foraminiferal _18O in this region is controlled primarily by temperature because modern hydrographic changes in North Iceland Shelf waters are dominated by temperature changes, with salinity playing a minor role (Smith, 2001; Smith et al., in review).

Thus, following this interpretation, changes in the proportion of precipitation reaching China corre- late with changes in Greenland temperature. The Yuan et al. [12] mechanism provides a single explanation for the fact that the y18O relationship seen in the northern tropics and subtropics at multiple sites is inverted with respect to Greenland.,evidence of equilibrium found from (1) lack of correlation between d18O and d13C and (2) Replicated sample from the same cave with different dripwater properties,groundwater d18O,from 1 to 19,,,,years,,,,,,Fraction of water vapor lost from an air mass,2,year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OyOWgsBrRwp5sjVgqS1GFO2wnRkwGNY4wUXIpib45N4 SP06RACA01,SP06RACA,,SP06RACA01,Speleothem (SP),,Carlsbad.Rasmussen.2006,2006,10.1029/2006GL025714,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,32.1,104.26,,Carlsbad cave,,,LaminaeThickness,mm,Annual growth bands from two stalagmites sampled in two nearby caves,,number and thickeness of stalagmite layers,rainfall amount,Pacific-modulated precipitation variability during the late Holocene from the southwestern USA: mechanisms driving drought cycles,annual,,the thickness of the laminae decrease during periods of drought,,,,The data are supported by U-Th results,,,years,It has been demonstrated that some speleothems from the Guadalupe Mountains in southeastern New Mexico are annually banded, and variations in band thickness and mineralogy can be used as a record of regional relative moisture [Asmerom and Polyak, 2004].,,Changes in precipitation over relatively short time periods are indicated by hiatuses in stalagmite growth and large-scale shifts in band thickness,,,no isotopic analyes here,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bxnCwCgUbDr2MFZp193p1MHzpsTuqPZuBYBzy1LcMCU SP07ASUS01A,SP07ASUS,,SP07ASUS01A,Speleothem (SP),,Asmerom, P,2007,10.1130/G22865A.1,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,32.083,-105.1667,,Pink Panter Cave, New Mexico,,,d18O,parts per mil,stable isotopes (d18O),,calcite powder,rainfall amount,more positive d18O values are interpreted to represent wetter conditions,under present conditions, wet years often have higehr amount of winter rain, but d18O may reflect high summer rain, winter rain, or both,negative,observed negative correlation between summer monsoon rainfall amount and d18O,,groundwater d18O,7-71,,,,years,observed negative correlation between summer monsoon rainfall amount and d18O,,negative,,,isotopic composition of rainfall,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLPUcn1ABQX_Rf5RWRDie6kyNZ6ZrNhq04Dpv-l2FvQ SP07DEUS01A,SP07DEUS,,SP07DEUS01A,Speleothem (SP),,Denniston, RF,2007,10.1016/j.yqres.2007.04.001,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,38.9,-92.3,,Devils Icebox Cave, Missouri,,,d18O,parts per mil,stable isotopes (d18O),,calcite powder,rainfall amount,more poritive d13C values reflect less rainfall amount,,negative,The influence of vegetation changes and changes in the water residence time on d13C of DIC.
